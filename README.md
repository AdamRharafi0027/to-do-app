## How It Works

### Core Functionality
- **State Management**: The app uses React's `useState` hook to manage tasks, input fields, and edit states.
- **Add Task**:
  - Input a task in the text field and click "Add" to append it to the list.
- **Edit Task**:
  - Click "Edit" next to a task, modify the text, and save the changes.
- **Delete Task**:
  - Click "Delete" next to a task to remove it from the list.

### Key Files
- **`ToDo.js`**:
  - Contains the main logic for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- **`ToDo.css`**:
  - Provides styles for the app.

---

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add task prioritization (e.g., high, medium, low priority).
- Persist tasks using local storage or a database.
- Add a "Mark as Completed" feature.
- Improve the UI/UX with animations and better styling.
